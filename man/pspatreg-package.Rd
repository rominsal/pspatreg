\title{Spatio-Temporal Semiparametric Regression Models with Spatial Lags.}
\description{
CHANGE THE DESCRIPTION OF THE PACKAGE...\pkg{spsur} offers the user a collection of functions to estimate Spatial 
  Seemingly Unrelated Regression (SUR) models by maximum likelihood or 
  three-stage least squares, using spatial instrumental variables. 
  Moreover, \pkg{spsur} obtains a collection of misspecification
  tests for omitted or wrongly specified spatial structure. The user will 
  find spatial models more popular in applied research such as the SUR-SLX, 
  SUR-SLM, SUR-SEM, SUR-SDM, SUR-SDEM SUR-SARAR and SUR-GNM 
  plus the spatially independent SUR, or SUR-SIM.

CHANGE THE DETAILS...
 Some functionalities that have been included in \pkg{sptpsar} package are:
}
\section{1. Testing for spatial effects}{

  The function \code{\link{lmtestspsur}} provides a collection of 
  Lagrange Multipliers, LM, for testing different forms of spatial 
  dependence in SUR models. They are extended versions of
  the well-known LM tests for omitted lags of the explained variable in 
  the right hand side of the equation, LM-SLM, the LM tests for omitted 
  spatial errors, LM-SEM, the join test of omitted spatial lags and 
  spatial errors, LM-SARAR, and the robust version of the firt
  two Lagrange Multipliers, LM*-SLM  and LM*-SEM. \cr
  These tests can be applied to models always with a SUR nature. Roughly, 
  we may distinguish two situations:
  \itemize{
   \item Datasets with a single equation \emph{G=1}, for different time 
   periods \emph{Tm>1} and a certain number of spatial units in the 
   cross-sectional dimension, \emph{N}. This is what we call
   \emph{spatial panel datasets}. In this case, the SUR structure appears 
   in form of (intra) serial dependence in the errors of each spatial unit.
   \item Datasets with a several equations \emph{G>1}, different time 
   periods \emph{Tm>1} and a certain number of spatial units, \emph{N}. 
   The SUR structure appears, as usual, because the errors
   of the spatial units for different equations are contemporaneously 
   correlated.
  }
}

\section{2. Estimation of the Spatial SUR models}{

  As indicated above, \pkg{spsur} package may work with a list of 
  different spatial specifications.
  They are the following:
  \itemize{
    \item \emph{SUR-SIM}: SUR model without spatial effects
           \deqn{ y_{tg} =  X_{tg} \beta_{g} + \epsilon_{tg} }
    \item \emph{SUR-SLX}: SUR model with spatial lags of the regresors
           \deqn{ y_{tg} = X_{tg} \beta_{g} + 
                           WX_{tg} \theta_{g} + \epsilon_{tg} }
    \item \emph{SUR-SLM}: SUR model with spatial lags of the endogenous
           \deqn{y_{tg} = \rho_{g} Wy_{tg} + X_{tg} \beta_{g} + 
                          \epsilon_{tg} }
     \item \emph{SUR-SEM}: SUR model with spatial errors
            \deqn{ y_{tg} = X_{tg} \beta_{g} + u_{tg} }
            \deqn{ u_{tg} = \lambda_{g} Wu_{tg} + \epsilon_{tg} }
     \item \emph{SUR-SDM}: SUR model with spatial lags of the endogenous 
           variable and of the regressors or Spatial Durbin model
           \deqn{ y_{tg} = \rho_{g} Wy_{tg} + X_{tg} \beta_{g} + 
                            WX_{tg} \theta_{g} + \epsilon_{tg} }
     \item \emph{SUR-SDEM}: SUR model with spatial errors and spatial 
           lags of the endogenous variable and of the regressors
            \deqn{ y_{tg} = X_{tg} \beta_{g} + WX_{tg} \theta_{g} + u_{tg} }
             \deqn{ u_{tg} = \lambda_{g} W u_{tg} + \epsilon_{tg} }
     \item \emph{SUR-SARAR}: Spatial lag model with spatial errors
            \deqn{ y_{tg} = \rho_{g} Wy_{tg} + X_{tg} \beta_{g} + 
                             u_{tg} }
             \deqn{ u_{tg} = \lambda_{g} W u_{tg} + \epsilon_{tg} }
     \item \emph{SUR-GNM}: SUR model with spatial lags of the explained 
       variables, regressors and spatial errors
      \deqn{ y_{tg} = \rho_{g} Wy_{tg} + X_{tg} \beta_{g} + 
                        WX_{tg} \theta_{g} + u_{tg} }
      \deqn{ u_{tg} = \lambda_{g} W u_{tg} + \epsilon_{tg} }
   }
         where \eqn{y_{tg}}, \eqn{u_{tg}} and \eqn{\epsilon_{tg}} are 
         \emph{(Nx1)} vectors; \eqn{X_{tg}} is a matrix of regressors of 
         order \emph{(NxP)}; \eqn{\rho_{g}} and \eqn{\lambda_{g}} are 
         parameters of spatial dependence and \emph{W} is the
         \emph{(NxN)} spatial weighting matrix.

        These specifications can be estimated by maximum-likelihood 
        methods, using the function \code{\link{spsurml}}. Moroever, 
        the models that include spatial lags of the explained
        variables in the right hand side of the equations, and the 
        errors are assumed to be spatially incorrelated (namely, the 
        SUR-SLM and the SUR-SDM), can also be estimated using
        three-stage least-squares, \code{\link{spsur3sls}}, 
        using spatial instrumental variable to correct for the problem of
        endogeneity present in these cases.
}

\section{3. Diagnostic tests}{

  Testing for inconsistencies or misspecifications in the results of an 
  estimated (SUR) model should be a primary task for the user. \pkg{spsur} 
  focuses, especifically, on two main question such as omitted
  or wrongly specified spatial structure and the existence of structural 
  breaks or relevant restrictions
  in the parameters of the model. In this sense, the user will find:

 \enumerate{
   \item \emph{Marginal tests} \cr
     The Marginal Multipliers test for omitted or wrongly specified spatial 
     structure in the equations. They are routinely part of the output of 
     the maximum-likelihood estimation, shown by \code{\link{spsurml}}. 
     In particular, the LM(\eqn{\rho}|\eqn{\lambda}) tests for omitted 
     spatial lags in a model specified with spatial errors (SUR-SEM; 
     SUR-SDEM). The LM(\eqn{\lambda}|\eqn{\rho}) tests for omitted 
     spatial error in a model specified with spatial lags
     of the explained variable (SUR-SLM; SUR-SDM).

   \item \emph{Coefficients stability tests} \cr
     \pkg{spsur} includes two functions designed to test for linear 
      restrictions on the \eqn{\beta} coefficients of the models and on 
      the spatial coefficients (\eqn{\rho}s and \eqn{\lambda}s terms). 
      The function for the first case is \code{\link{wald_betas}} and
     \code{\link{wald_deltas}} that of the second case. The user has 
     ample flexibility to define different forms of linear restrictions, 
     so that it is possible, for example,
     to test for their time constancy to identify structural breaks.
 }
}

\section{4. Marginal effects}{

  In recent years, since the publication of LeSage and Pace (2009), 
  it has become popular in
  spatial econometrics to evaluate the multiplier effects that a change in 
  the value of a regressor, in a point in the space, has on the explained 
  variable. \pkg{spsur} includes a function, \code{\link{impacts}}, 
  that computes these effects. Specifically, \code{\link{impacts}} obtains
  the average, over the \emph{N} spatial units and \emph{Tm} time periods, 
  of such a change on the contemporaneous value of the explained variable 
  located in the same point as the modified variable. This is the 
  so-called \emph{Average Direct effect}. The \emph{Average Indirect 
  effect} measure the proportion of the impact that spills-over to other 
  locations. The sum of the two effects is the \emph{Average Total effect}. 
  \cr
  These estimates are complemented with a measure of statistical 
  significance, following the randomization approach suggested by 
  LeSage and Pace (2009).
}

\section{5. Additional functionalities}{

  A particular feature of \pkg{spsur} is that the package allows to 
  obtain simulated datasets with a SUR nature and the spatial structure 
  decided by the user. This is the purpose of the function 
  \code{\link{dgp_spsur}}. The function can be inserted into a more 
  general code to solve, for example, Monte Carlo studies related to 
  these type of models or, simply, to show some of the stylized 
  characteristics of a SUR model with certain spatial structure.

\section{Datasets}{

  INCLUDE DATASET OF UNEMPLOYMENT IN ITALY AND EXPLAIN...
  \pkg{spsur} includes three different datasets: spc, NCOVR and spain.covid. These 
  sets are used to 
  illustrate the capabilities of different functions. Briefly, their 
  main characteristics are the following \cr
  \itemize{
    \item The \emph{spc} dataset (Spatial Phillips-Curve) is a 
     classical dataset taken from Anselin (1988, p. 203), of small 
     dimensions.
     \item The \emph{NCOVR} dataset comprises Homicides and a list of 
     selected socio-economic variables for continental U.S. counties 
     in four decennial census years: 1960, 1970, 1980 and 1990. 
     It is freely available from
       \url{https://geodacenter.github.io/data-and-lab/ncovr/}. 
       \emph{NCOVR} is a typical spatial panel dataset \emph{(G=1)}.
     \item The \emph{spain.covid} dataset comprises Within and Exit mobility index 
     together with the weeklly incidence COVID-19 at Spain provinces from 
     February 21 to May 21 2020.
